# Vendor Management System with Performance Metrics

A Vendor Management System using Django and Django REST Framework. This system will handle vendor profiles, track purchase orders, and calculate vendor performance metrics. Please read the below documentation to understand how to interact with the various API endpoints.

Note: If you are contributing, please go through [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/acmpesuecc/vendor-system/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Prerequisites 

- IDE
- MySQL
- Postman (requiered for token-based authentication)

## Getting Started

### Installing libraries
    
    pip install django
    pip install djangorestframework
    pip install mysqlclient

### Database Connection

If you're using MySQL, make sure to configure the database settings (`settings.py`). 

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',       # Database engine
            'NAME': 'vendor_system',                    # Database name
            'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',                   # Database user (usually root)
            'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',                   # Database password
            'HOST': 'localhost',                        # Database host
            'PORT': '3306',                             # Database port
        }
    }

You can interact with the database using the MySQL CMD Line Client or use the command below to connect to the MySQL server using your username, with the server prompting you to enter the password for the user.
    
    mysql -u your_user_name -p 
    create database vendor_system;

### Setting up Postman

Postman is a tool for testing and interacting with APIs. To set up Postman for interacting with the APIs, create a new collection named "VendorManagementSystem" and add requests within it. Right-click on the collection to add a request, then choose the HTTP request method `(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)` and paste the corresponding URL for the desired API endpoint. Input data can be entered by selecting `Body` tab, then choosing `raw and JSON` format, and pasting the data accordingly. Ensure to follow the provided examples for input data structure.

### Token-based Authentication

The API endpoints have been secured with token-based authentication. Create credentials using `python manage.py createsuperuser`. To obtain a token for a session, paste the `api/token/` endpoint and choose the HTTP request method `POST` on Postman. Credentials can be entered by:

```json
{
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password"
}
```
A token will be displayed in the output. Please save this token for futher use. To use the endpoints, select the `Header` tab, then enter `Authorization` under Key and `Token token_number` under Value. You now have access to the endpoint. This must be done for all endpoints. If not:

    {
        "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
    }

### IMPORTANT

1. The actual delivery date of the products is assumed to be a week from the order date.
2. Detailed documentation regarding the API endpoints is present below. 
3. For more input data structures, please refer to `docs.md`.

## Historical Model

The HistoricalPerformance model stores historical data on vendor performance, allowing for trend analysis. It can be viewed using `select * from performance`. This model stores records of vendors evertime there is a change in the metrics. 

## Database Queries (in case you want to restart)

    DELETE FROM orders;
    DELETE FROM performance;
    DELETE FROM vendor;
    
    ALTER TABLE vendor AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;
    ALTER TABLE orders AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;
    ALTER TABLE performance AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;

## Test Suites

To run the test suites, enter the following commands to the terminal:

    python manage.py test myapp.tests.test_serialiser
    python manage.py test myapp.tests.test_views
    python manage.py test myapp.tests.test_models
